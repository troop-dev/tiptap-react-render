# TipTap React Render

This tool enables rendering TipTap JSON payloads in React clients without embedding the editor.

### Installation
```sh
# TODO
```

### Usage
```ts
// TODO: sample
```

**Why?**
Many folks render TipTap rich text by embedding the TipTap editor in a "read-only" mode. However, if you don't want to add TipTap as a dependency (or, like us, you're using a platform that can't support it like React Native), then this is a simple, lightweight tool for mapping TipTap nodes to presentation components!

**Inspiration**
We were inspired by Contentful's [rich-text-react-renderer](https://github.com/contentful/rich-text/tree/master/packages/rich-text-react-renderer) tool, so we built a similar one for TipTap payloads!
