# TipTap React Render

### Why?

Many folks render TipTap rich text by embedding the TipTap editor in a "read-only" mode. However, if you don't want to add TipTap as a dependency (or, like us, you're using a platform that can't support it like React Native), then this is a simple, lightweight tool for mapping TipTap nodes to presentation components!

We were inspired by Contentful's [rich-text-react-renderer](https://github.com/contentful/rich-text/tree/master/packages/rich-text-react-renderer) tool, so we built a similar one for TipTap payloads!

This repo was scaffolded using the [@alexeagleson/template-react-component-library](https://github.com/alexeagleson/template-react-component-library)
